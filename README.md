# What the hack! 2022: Sustainable and Smart Cities

## Idea: Car-Tell
CarTell is a project aiming to tackle the many ineffiencies of finding available parking lots in large and crowded carparks, where a lot of time is spent either idling or driving around to find the few available lots. Doing so reduces the pollutants generated by cars in urban areas.

The goal is to create a user-friendly mobile application and IoT system that can be used by drivers to find available parking spots in crowded carparks.

## Hardware
This github repo contains code used on the ESP32 to send data to and from Google real-time firebase, as well as read from IR sensors we placed on our prototype mockup to simulate the ultrasonic sensors used in real carparks. 

The prototype is simplified to have only 2 floor, with 4 lots each. This allows more rapid prototyping for the sake of time.
